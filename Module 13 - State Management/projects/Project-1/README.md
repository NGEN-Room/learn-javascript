# Project – Light Switch

## 🧠 Goal:
Build a toggleable switch that updates the DOM and tracks internal state.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create an HTML file with:
   - A button `<button id="lightSwitch">Turn ON</button>`
   - A box `<div id="lightBox"></div>`

2. In your script:
   - Track light state with `let isOn = false`
   - When clicked, toggle `isOn` and:
     - Change button text
     - Change the background color of the box

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
(light is on)
Button: Turn OFF
Box color: yellow
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add a status text (e.g. “Light is currently on.”)
- Track how many times it’s been switched
- Use CSS classes instead of inline `.style`

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Create and open your `index.html` in a browser and test the switch!
