# Project – Scope Tracker

## 🧠 Goal:
Use `var`, `let`, and `const` in different scopes and observe how they behave.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create a variable `score` in the global scope
2. Create a function `updateScore()` that:
   - Declares a new `score` using `let` or `var`
   - Logs the value
3. Call the function and log the global `score` after

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Inside function: 50
Outside function: 100
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add a conditional (`if`) block and test `let` vs `var` inside it
- Create a bug by logging before declaring, and explain the result
- Build a visual table in HTML to log what’s accessible where
