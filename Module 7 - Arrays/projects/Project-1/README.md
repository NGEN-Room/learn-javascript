# Project – Task Tracker (Array Version)

## 🧠 Goal:
Use an array to store and manage a to-do list.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create an array `tasks` with a few string values (e.g. "Do dishes", "Do homework")
2. Use `.push()` to add a new task
3. Print the full list using a loop
4. Use `.pop()` to remove the last task and print which task was removed

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Current tasks:
- Do dishes
- Do homework
- Feed cat

Removed task: Feed cat
Remaining tasks:
- Do dishes
- Do homework
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Let the user add or remove a task using `prompt()`
- Log how many tasks are in the list using `.length`
- Build a second array for "completed" tasks
