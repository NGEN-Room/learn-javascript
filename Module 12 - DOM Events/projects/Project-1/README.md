# Project – Click Counter

## 🧠 Goal:
Track the number of times a button is clicked and show it on the screen.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create an HTML file with:
   - A button `<button id="counterBtn">Click me</button>`
   - A paragraph `<p id="count">Count: 0</p>`

2. In your script:
   - Use an event listener to detect clicks
   - Update the count and display it

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Count: 3
(when clicked three times)
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Use a second button to reset the counter
- Add styles that change when count increases
- Display a message at certain milestones (e.g. “You reached 10!”)
