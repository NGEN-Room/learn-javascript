# Project – Countdown Challenge

## 🧠 Goal:
Build a script that counts down from 10 to 1 using a loop.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create a `for` or `while` loop that counts down from 10
2. Print each number in the console
3. Print “Blast off!” at the end

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
10
9
8
...
1
Blast off!
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Let the user set the starting number (manually with `let`)
- Add a `.length` countdown for a fake “timer” display
- Use `continue` to skip certain numbers (e.g. skip odd numbers)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Link your script to an HTML file and open it in the browser.  
Right click → Inspect → Console to see the countdown.
