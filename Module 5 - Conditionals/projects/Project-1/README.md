# Project – Adventure Game Prompt

## 🧠 Goal:
Use `if/else` and `switch` to build a basic text prompt that reacts to the player’s input.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create a variable `direction` and set it to `"left"`, `"right"`, or `"forward"`
2. Use `if` or `switch` to print a response based on the chosen direction

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
You chose to go left.
You fall into a trap! Game over.
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add a second variable: `hasKey = true` or `false`
- Add a locked door check using `if (hasKey)`
- Turn this into a mini choose-your-own-path experience
- **Challenge yourself:** Try using `prompt()` to ask the user for a direction!  
  👉 *Search "javascript prompt()" to see how it works*

## ▶️ How to Run

Link your JS to an HTML file. Change the variable value, then refresh and check the browser console for different outcomes.
