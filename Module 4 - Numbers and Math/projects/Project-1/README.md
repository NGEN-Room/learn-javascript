# Project – Dice Roller 🎲

## 🧠 Goal:
Simulate rolling two dice using math, and output the result using variables.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create two random numbers between 1–6 using `Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1)`
2. Store them in `die1` and `die2`
3. Calculate the sum and store in `total`
4. Print the result nicely formatted

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
You rolled a 4 and a 6.
Total: 10
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add a `double` bonus message if both dice match
- Log if the roll is “high” (9+) or “low” (<=5)
- Let the user “roll” multiple times by refreshing or using a loop
