## ⚙️ Setup Checklist

1. **Install VS Code**
   👉 https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. **Install Node.js** (optional, for advanced modules)
   👉 https://nodejs.org/

3. **Create your workspace**
   - Make a new folder `learn-js`
   - Inside, create a file `index.html` and another `script.js`

4. **Connect your JS file**
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First JS</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, JavaScript!</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## ✍️ Your First JS
```javascript
// script.js
console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!");
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- `console.log()` outputs messages to the browser’s dev tools
- `<script src="">` connects your JS file to HTML
- JS files end with `.js` and run top-to-bottom
