# Project – Leaderboard Generator

## 🧠 Goal:
Use higher-order functions to filter and sort a list of players by score.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create an array of players (objects with `name` and `score`)
2. Use `.filter()` to find players with score above 50
3. Use `.map()` to create a new array of strings like `"Name: Piha (Score: 88)"`
4. Use `.reduce()` to calculate the total score

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Qualified Players:
- Name: Aria (Score: 72)
- Name: Piha (Score: 88)

Total Team Score: 160
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Sort players by score (use `.sort()`)
- Add a badge for anyone over 90: `"🌟 Aria – 95"`
- Only show top 3 performers
