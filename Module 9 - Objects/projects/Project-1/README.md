# Project – Character Profile Builder

## 🧠 Goal:
Use an object to model a player character in a game.

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create an object `character` with keys:
   - `name`, `class`, `level`, `isAlive`
2. Use `console.log()` to print each property
3. Update one property (like level or isAlive) and log it again

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Name: Kaia
Class: Mage
Level: 7
Alive: true

Level up!
New level: 8
```

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add an `inventory` array with 3 items
- Create a method `introduce()` that logs a summary
- Try logging `typeof character` and `typeof character.name`
