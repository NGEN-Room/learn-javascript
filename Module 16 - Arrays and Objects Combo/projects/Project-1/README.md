# Project – Shopping Cart

## 🧠 Goal:
Build a cart that holds a list of products using objects inside an array.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create an array `cart` with at least 3 products:
   - Each product should be an object with `name`, `price`, and `quantity`

2. Use a loop to print out each product:
   - Format: “2x Apples – $4.00 each”

3. Calculate and display the total price

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Shopping Cart:
1x Apples – $3.00
2x Oranges – $2.50
Total: $8.00
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add a `.toFixed(2)` for price formatting
- Use `.push()` to add a new item to the cart
- Let the user "checkout" with a summary message

## ▶️ How to Run

Run your script in the browser console or create a simple HTML page to display the result.
