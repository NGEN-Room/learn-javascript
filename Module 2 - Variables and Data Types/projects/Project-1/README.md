# Project ‚Äì Basic Calculator

## üß† Goal:
Build a script that simulates a mini calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, while introducing how variables work.

---

## üîß Instructions

1. Create a file `script.js`
2. Declare two variables: `num1`, `num2`
3. Add them together and store in a new variable `sum`
4. Print the result using `console.log()`
5. now do this for subtraction, multiplication and division. 
6. run these using `console.log()` to see if your code works

---

## üß™ Example Output:

Welcome to SimpleCalc!
Your numbers: 8 and 3
Sum: 11
Difference: 5

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Challenge:
- Use `typeof` to confirm both are numbers
- Try assigning strings and observe what happens
- Add a `const` for the app name and log it before the result

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Link your script to `index.html` and open it in your browser.  
Use `console.log()` to display results in the DevTools console.
