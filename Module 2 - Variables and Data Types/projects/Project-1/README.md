# Project – Basic Calculator

## 🧠 Goal:
Build a simple calculator that adds two numbers using variables.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create a file `script.js`
2. Declare two variables: `num1`, `num2`
3. Add them together and store in a new variable `sum`
4. Print the result using `console.log()`

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Use `typeof` to confirm both are numbers
- Try assigning strings and observe what happens
- Add a `const` for the app name and log it before the result

---

## ▶️ How to Run
Link your script to `index.html` and open it in your browser.  
Use `console.log()` to display results in the DevTools console.
