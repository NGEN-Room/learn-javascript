# Project – Inventory Merger

## 🧠 Goal:
Use destructuring and spread syntax to manage and merge player inventories.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

1. Create two arrays:
   - `bag1 = ["potion", "map"]`
   - `bag2 = ["sword", "key"]`

2. Merge them into `fullBag` using spread

3. Use destructuring to assign:
   - `firstItem` and `secondItem` from `fullBag`

4. Log the merged inventory and key items

---

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Your bag contains: potion, map, sword, key
First two items: potion, map
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Challenges:
- Add a third bag and merge all into `masterBag`
- Create an `inventory` object and destructure its values
- Use `...` to clone and update the object with a new item
